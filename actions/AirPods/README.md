# Connect / Disconnect AirPods

![Action Sample Usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlinzner/LaunchBarActions/master/resources/LBAction-Airpod.png)

An action to quickly connect / disconnect your AirPods (or BeatsX). Unfortunately this still requires UI Scripting and the Bluetooth menubar item (altought you can hide it with tools like [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com)). Before using the action it is necessary to adjust the `airpod_name` variable to match the name of your AirPods in default.scpt.
