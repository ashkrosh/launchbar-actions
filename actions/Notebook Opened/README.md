# Notebook Opened

Have you ever forgotten to start a work timer? OS X is able to provide you with a good hint on that. The command `pmset` lists LidOpen events for notebooks. But as this is not as easy to access, I've created a LaunchBar Action to quickly lookup the last events.

Kudos to [@alpi](https://twitter.com/alpi/status/743012477168930816) for the idea!
