# Control Spotify Actions

A set of Spotify Actions meant as a replacement for the built-in iTunes actions. Right now the set contains the following actions:

- Play / Pause
- Next Song
- Previous Song
- Toggle Repeat
- Toggle Shuffle
- Share Current Song (on Twitter or Facebook)

If you are a Spotify user, make sure to take a look at [nosrac's search action](https://github.com/Nosrac/LBSpotify) as well!
